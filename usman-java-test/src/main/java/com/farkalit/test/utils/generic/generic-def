Generics in Java

Generics mean parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc, 
and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. 
Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. 
An entity such as class, interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is called a generic entity.

Why Generics?

The Object is the superclass of all other classes and Object reference can refer to any type object.
 These features lack type safety. Generics add that type safety feature. 
 We will discuss that type of safety feature in later examples.
Generics in Java is similar to templates in C++. 
For example, classes like HashSet, ArrayList, HashMap, etc use generics very well. 
There are some fundamental differences between the two approaches to generic types.
